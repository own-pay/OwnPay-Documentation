# Developer Guide

OwnPay exposes a full REST API that lets you integrate payment collection into any application. This guide covers the three main areas: server-side integration (PHP and Node.js), webhook event handling, and extending OwnPay through the plugin system.

## Quick Reference

| Topic | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Base URL | `https://your-domain.com/api/v1` |
| Auth header | `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>` |
| Response format | JSON — `{ success, data, message }` |
| Webhook algo | HMAC-SHA256 |
| Rate limit (API keys) | 120 requests / minute |
| Rate limit (mobile) | 60 requests / minute |

## Authentication

All API requests require a Bearer token. Generate API keys in the **Admin Panel → Developer Hub**.

```http
Authorization: Bearer op_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Keys can be scoped to **read-only** or **full access** and are tied to a specific brand. Rotate keys under Developer Hub → API Keys → Regenerate.

## Base URL

```
https://your-domain.com/api/v1
```

Replace `your-domain.com` with your OwnPay installation domain. All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1`.

## Response Envelope

Every response wraps data in a consistent envelope:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... },
  "message": "Operation successful"
}
```

Error responses include an `errors` object:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "errors": {
    "amount": ["Amount must be greater than 0"]
  }
}
```

Standard HTTP status codes apply: `200 OK`, `201 Created`, `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, `422 Unprocessable Entity`, `429 Too Many Requests`.
