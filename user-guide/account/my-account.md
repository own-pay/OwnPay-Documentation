## Configuration Guide

* **Secure Key Storage:**
  * OwnPay utilizes secure encryption wrappers for sensitive account parameters. User passwords are hashed with `Argon2id` using high-iteration variables.
  * TOTP secrets (`totp_secret_enc` in the `op_merchant_users` table) are stored utilizing `AES-256-GCM` encryption.
* **TOTP Drift Window:**
  * OwnPay validates OTP codes with a drift allowance window of `1` (allowing codes +/- 30 seconds from current server time to compensate for slight device time mismatches).

## Best Practices

- ✅ **Do:** Enable 2FA immediately on all administrative and staff profiles.
- ✅ **Do:** Write down and store the 2FA backup text secret in a secure physical location or password vault before enabling.
- ❌ **Don't:** Share your password or 2FA secrets with anyone, including support staff.
- ❌ **Don't:** Disable 2FA unless transferring the profile to a new authenticator device.

## Must Do

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If a staff member or administrator loses access to their authenticator device and is locked out, the super-administrator must clear the user's `two_factor_enabled` and `totp_secret_enc` values in the database, or reset their account via the **Staff** settings menu.

## Notes

* 2FA verification attempts enforce rate-limiting rules to block brute-force guessing attacks.
