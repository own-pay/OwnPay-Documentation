# Payment Links

> **Purpose:** Generate shareable payment URLs with optional custom input fields to collect one-off or recurring payments directly from customers.

---

## Overview

Payment Links are reusable checkout URLs designed to collect payments without generating a formal invoice. You can create a link for a fixed product price or leave the amount open so customers can input their own values (e.g. for donations or dynamic service fees). They are ideal for social media sharing, email buttons, or quick SMS-based collections.

## Configuration Guide

* **Custom Fields & Quantities:**
  * When a customer visits a payment link with a fixed amount, they see the locked price.
  * If the link has a custom amount, the customer is prompted with an input field to enter their desired payment.
* **Tracking Use Count:**
  * Every successful payment completed via a payment link increments the `use_count` in the database. If `use_count` reaches `max_uses`, the link's status changes to `expired` and returns a 404/expired screen to subsequent visitors.

## Best Practices

- ✅ **Do:** Set a **Max Uses** value (e.g. `1`) if generating a single-use payment link for a specific customer.
- ✅ **Do:** Enforce **Require Shipping Address** if you are selling physical goods that need to be delivered.
- ❌ **Don't:** Change the slug of a payment link after sharing it, as this will break the existing URLs shared with customers.
- ❌ **Don't:** Use payment links for itemized corporate invoicing where details like due dates and item quantities need to be structured.

---

## Must Do

> ⚠️ Ensure that your manual gateways or API gateways are active before sharing a payment link, or customers will see an error when trying to choose a payment method.

---

## Optional / Can Skip

- **Max Uses** and **Expires At** settings are optional and can be left at defaults to keep links open indefinitely.

---

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Customer sees a `Link Expired` error page | The link reached its **Max Uses** limit or the **Expires At** date has passed. | Edit the link in the admin panel and increase the max uses or extend/remove the expiry date. |
| Customer cannot select a payment method on the link | No payment gateways are active for the selected currency. | Navigate to **Payment Gateways** and activate at least one gateway (e.g. manual bkash/Nagad or card merchant configs). |
