# Invoices

> **Purpose:** Detailed billing tool to create, customize, and issue itemized invoices to customers for custom goods or services.

---

## Overview

The Invoices page enables you to issue structured, multi-item billings to your customers. Customers receive a unique payment link where they can choose their preferred payment method (such as bKash, Nagad, or card options) to complete the invoice. The billing amounts, currency, and line items are tracked natively in your merchant ledger.

## Configuration Guide

* **Invoice Status Transitions:**
  * `draft`: The invoice has been saved but not sent to the customer.
  * `sent`: The invoice checkout link has been shared with the customer.
  * `paid`: The customer successfully processed payment via a gateway.
  * `overdue`: The due date has passed without successful payment.
  * `cancelled`: The invoice was marked as void by the merchant.
* **Auto-Recalculation:** Saving or updating an invoice automatically recalculates the subtotal and total from the line items list. Stale line item calculations are purged on save.

## Best Practices

- ✅ **Do:** Create a customer entry first before attempting to draft an invoice for them.
- ✅ **Do:** Click **Copy Link** to easily share the checkout URL via email, SMS, or Slack.
- ❌ **Don't:** Manually edit the database values of invoice totals; always update the line items so the system recalculates them correctly.
- ❌ **Don't:** Leave invoice numbers empty or duplicate them, as the system enforces unique invoice numbers per brand.

## Must Do

> ⚠️ When editing or saving an invoice, ensure that at least one (1) line item is present. Invoices with zero line items will result in a total of `0.00` BDT and cannot be processed.

---

## Optional / Can Skip

- **Notes** are entirely optional and can be left blank if not required.

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Invoices total shows `0.00` BDT after save | Line items were not specified, or quantity/amount fields were left at zero. | Edit the invoice and specify valid quantities and unit prices for all line items. |
| Cannot see a customer in the dropdown | The customer has not been added to your brand yet. | Navigate to **People → Customers**, add the customer, and return to the invoice editor. |
