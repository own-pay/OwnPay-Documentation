## Configuration Guide

* **Transaction Status Life Cycle:**
  * `pending`: The customer opened the checkout screen but has not completed payment.
  * `completed`: The payment was successfully processed, and the funds have been registered.
  * `failed`: The payment processor rejected the transaction.
  * `refunded`: The funds were returned to the customer, and a reversing ledger entry was posted.
  * `cancelled`: The checkout expired or was explicitly cancelled by the customer.

## Best Practices

- ✅ **Do:** Verify the **Gateway TRX ID** against your physical bank/wallet statements (like bKash or Nagad merchant statements) before delivering high-value goods.
- ✅ **Do:** Monitor **Failed** transactions to determine if customers are facing issues with specific payment gateways.
- ❌ **Don't:** Manually verify or force-complete a transaction unless you have absolute proof of receipt.
- ❌ **Don't:** Share screenshots of transaction detail screens containing customer IP addresses or personal emails.

---

## Must Do

> ⚠️ Before refunding a transaction, verify that the reversing debit ledger entry will not push your merchant account balance below zero.

---

## Optional / Can Skip

- **Date Range Filters** can be left blank to view all transactions regardless of when they occurred.

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| No transactions show up | You are in "Global View" but have no global permissions, or you switched to a brand with no transactions. | Double-check the **Brand Context** in the top header and switch to the correct brand. |
| The status remains `pending` after customer claims to have paid | The webhook callback from the gateway (e.g. bKash IPN) failed, or the SMS parsing device is offline. | Check the Developer Webhook logs or the Paired Devices screen to see if SMS matches are pending admin review. |
