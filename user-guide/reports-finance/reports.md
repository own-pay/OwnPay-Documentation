# Reports

> **Purpose:** Monitor business performance metrics, analyze transaction volumes, audit gateway fees, and export data.

## Overview

The Reports page compiles analytics for your active brand. It provides visual summary cards for key performance indicators (KPIs) like Total Revenue, Transactions Count, Average Transaction value, and Total Gateway Fees. You can run custom queries by filtering by dates and specific gateways, and download reports in CSV format.

## Configuration Guide

* **CSV Data Mapping:**
  * When exporting data:
    * The system loops over the `op_transactions` database records scoped to your active brand.
    * The output columns map directly to: `ID`, `Gateway`, `Currency`, `Amount`, `Status`, `Date`.
    * Refunded gateway fees are deducted from the net calculation outputs.

## Best Practices

- ✅ **Do:** Regularly export CSV logs and archive them to secure local servers for bookkeeping backup.
- ✅ **Do:** Compare **Total Fees** metrics against your physical statements to ensure gateway fee percentages are configured correctly.
- ❌ **Don't:** Select excessively wide date ranges (e.g., more than 1 year) if your brand processes thousands of transactions daily, as this can slow down server responses.
- ❌ **Don't:** Share CSV reports containing customer transaction IDs and personal contact details with unauthorized staff.

## Must Do

> ⚠️ Double-check that your base default currency matches your report expectations. If your brand context defaults to BDT, all amounts shown in the reports cards represent BDT values.
