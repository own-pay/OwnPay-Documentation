## Unreleased

### Fixed

- **bKash API gateway** — `payerReference` and `merchantInvoiceNumber` fields sent to bKash are now sanitized to alphanumeric characters only, preventing gateway-side rejection of transaction IDs containing punctuation.
- **Custom domain resolution** — removed an overly strict host-allowlist check in `DomainUrlService`'s request-host fallback that caused white-labeled custom domains to incorrectly resolve to `localhost` when the request arrived through an Nginx reverse proxy. The check was redundant: `DomainMiddleware` (global middleware stack) already rejects any request whose `Host` header does not match the master domain or an active, DNS-verified custom domain before this code path is reached.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-30

> **Initial public release.** OwnPay is a self-hosted, enterprise-grade, open-source payment gateway platform built on PHP 8.3+. A single owner operates the full system; multiple brands (stores) run under isolated custom domains — each with its own gateways, ledger, customers, and visual identity.

---

### Added

#### Core Framework

- Lightweight **PSR-11 dependency injection container** with reflection-based auto-wiring and singleton/transient lifecycle support.
- 10-step **Kernel boot cycle**: environment loading → container build → timezone config → plugin boot → middleware stack → `system.boot` event → route compilation → request matching → controller dispatch → `system.shutdown` event.
- **WordPress-style hook/filter system** (`EventManager`) with named action queues and priority-ordered filter chains, available to every plugin.
- **PSR-4 autoloading** of all application code under the `OwnPay\` namespace (`src/`).
- **Graceful last-resort error renderer** (`ErrorPageRenderer`) — fully inline HTML, zero service dependencies, renders 500/503/maintenance pages even when Twig, the database, or the DI container is broken.
- **Maintenance mode** with segment-aware path whitelist (`/admin`, `/login`, `/webhook`, `/cron`, `/checkout`) so gateway callbacks continue processing and the operator can still log in during downtime.

#### Multi-Brand Architecture

- **Single-owner, multi-brand model**: one super-administrator manages N brands (`op_merchants`), each isolated by `merchant_id` across every scoped database table.
- **`TenantScope` trait** — enforces brand data isolation at the query layer; provides `forTenant()`, `forAllTenants()`, `paginateScoped()`, `findScoped()`, `createScoped()`, `updateScoped()`, `deleteScoped()`.
- **`BrandContext` service** — resolves active brand from request, handles the All-Brands (platform) scope, exposes `getPlatformId()` and `getWriteMerchantId()` to prevent data cross-contamination.
- **Reserved platform-owner row** (`is_platform = 1`, slug `__platform__`) seeded by migration `013_add_platform_owner.sql`; excluded from all brand selectors.
- **Brand-scoped settings cascade**: `SettingsRepository::getScoped()` resolves brand override → All-Brands global default → code default.
- **Per-brand RBAC** — `op_roles` + `op_role_permissions`; `brands.access_all` permission gates cross-brand (All-Brands) access. `PermissionMiddleware::resolvePermission()` maps every admin route to its required permission slug.

#### White-Label Custom Domains

- **`DomainMiddleware`** — resolves every inbound `HTTP_HOST` against `op_domains`; injects `merchant_id`, `custom_domain`, and `domain_type` into request attributes; returns HTTP 404 for `/admin/*` paths on custom domains; returns HTTP 503 for domains pending DNS verification.
- **`DomainUrlService`** — single source of truth for all customer-facing and gateway-facing URL construction with priority: `GATEWAY_CALLBACK_URL` env → brand custom domain → `APP_URL` → request host → `https://localhost`.
- DNS verification workflow with `dns_verified` flag; unverified domains are fully blocked.
- `APP_DOMAIN` bare-hostname env var used as the master-domain sentinel.

#### Installer Wizard

- Four-step guided installation: directory permission checks → database probing + schema build → superadmin & default brand creation → key generation + `.env` write + `storage/.installed` lock marker.
- Installer middleware group is **database-independent** by design — no session, settings, or DB-backed rate-limiter middleware; `RateLimiterMiddleware` wraps DB access in try/catch for graceful bypass.
- Base64-safe `.env` parsing via `vlucas/phpdotenv` (avoids `parse_ini_file` breakage on base64 `APP_KEY`/`ENCRYPTION_KEY`).

#### Admin Panel

- Responsive admin panel with dark-mode, glassmorphism UI, and mobile-aware sidebar navigation.
- Sidebar order: Dashboard → Payments → Gateways → People → Mobile & SMS → Reports & Finance → Developers → Appearance → System → Account.
- Dashboard with real-time KPIs: total revenue, pending transactions, active gateways, and brand health indicators.
- **`AdminPageTrait`** — centralises template rendering, brand-scoped logo/favicon injection, and `requireGlobalView()` guard for All-Brands-only operations.
- Full CRUD admin pages: Brands, Staff, Roles & Permissions, Customers, Gateways, API Keys, Invoices, Payment Links, Transactions, Manual Gateways, Webhooks/IPN, Audit Log, System Settings, Currency Management, Exchange Rates, Reports, Appearance / Branding, Landing Page CMS, and Dispute Management.

- **Plugin manifest schema** (`manifest.json`) with slug validation, entrypoint declaration, type whitelist (`gateway|addon|theme`), optional `routes`, `cron`, `admin_menu`, `namespace`, `migrations`, and `csp` keys.
- **Footgun scanner** (`PluginSandbox`) — token-scans every plugin PHP file at load time and blocks `eval`, `exec`, `shell_exec`, `system`, `passthru`, `popen`, `proc_open`.
- **Dynamic plugin logo resolution** (`PluginManager::resolveIconPath()`) — copies gateway icons into `public/assets/img/gateways/` on demand; rejects non-image extensions.
- Plugin activation, deactivation, and uninstall lifecycle with database migration execution.
- Per-brand plugin activation state enforced through `EventManager` owner stack.
- **Multi-file plugin support**: PSR-4 autoloader registered per plugin, realpath-contained to the plugin directory.

#### Manual (Offline) Gateway System

- **Platform template + per-brand account** model: All-Brands view defines the gateway type (slug, name, logo, input schema, currency limits, SMS rules); each brand adds its own account row (payment instructions, QR code).
- `ManualGatewayRepository::listActiveForCheckout()` — collapses template + brand account into one row per slug at checkout; brand account always wins over platform template.
- `GatewayController::createManual` guarded by `requireGlobalView()`.

#### Double-Entry Ledger Engine

- Full **GAAP-compliant double-entry bookkeeping** (`op_ledger_accounts`, `op_ledger_transactions`, `op_ledger_entries`).
- Every journal entry posts balanced debit/credit pairs; balance is maintained as a schema-level constraint.
- GAAP directionality enforced: Asset/Expense balances increase on debit; Liability/Equity/Revenue balances increase on credit.
- Ledger accounts strictly scoped to brand via `LedgerRepository::findOrCreateAccount()`.
- Mutex-locked transaction posting to prevent race-condition double-posting.
- Refund processing integrated into the ledger with atomic DB transactions and balance validation (`RefundService`).

#### Checkout & Payment Flows

- **Payment Intent checkout** (`/checkout/{token}`) — branded, white-labeled single-page checkout with per-brand CSS variables, custom CSS/JS injection, and checkout hook triggers.
- **Invoice system** — line-item invoices with dynamic subtotal/total recalculation; `op_invoice_items` purged and reinserted on every update to prevent orphan records.
- **Payment links** (`/pay/{slug}`) — shareable, reusable payment pages with configurable amounts.
- **Dispute management** — dispute creation, status tracking, and resolution workflow.
- **Gateway callback lease** — atomic `status: processing → callback_processing` UPDATE prevents concurrent double-capture; lease is released on soft failure so later retries can still complete.
- **Webhook IPN processor** (`WebhookInboundProcessor`) — processes inbound gateway webhooks, accepts `callback_processing` transactions as completable, with retry queue and audit-log integrity tracking.
- **Dynamic Content Security Policy** built from active gateway manifest `csp` declarations only (never all 123 bundles); 7,500-byte failsafe prevents FastCGI header overflow on shared hosting.
- **CSRF protection** on all mutation endpoints via `CsrfMiddleware` and `SecurityHelpers::csrfToken()`.

#### Multi-Currency & Exchange Rates

- Currency management with `op_currencies` (ISO 4217) seeded for all major currencies; `decimal_places` per currency.
- `op_exchange_rates` — `base_currency`/`target_currency` UNIQUE pair with manual and automated rate update support.
- `CurrencyService::convert()` — pivots through system base currency at checkout for automatic gateway currency conversion.
- Immutable audit trail fields (`original_amount`, `original_currency`, `exchange_rate`, `converted_amount`, `converted_currency`) persisted in `op_transactions.metadata`.
- `supportedCurrencies(): array` on every gateway adapter; empty array = any currency via `GatewayDefaults` trait; BDT-only gateways (bKash, Nagad) explicitly declare `['BDT']`.

#### Companion Mobile App & SMS Verification

- **Android companion app** backend: device pairing via OTP exchange, JWT issuance and rotation, JTI blacklisting in `op_cache`.
- `op_paired_devices` — stores paired device UUID, last heartbeat, and revocation state.
- **`JwtAuthMiddleware`** — validates JWT tokens against live database state; revoked/deactivated devices are denied immediately.
- **SMS verification engine** (`SmsVerificationJob`) — matches inbound bank/gateway SMS against pending transactions by provider transaction ID (exact) or amount + gateway + time window (single unambiguous brand match only; ambiguous multi-brand amounts are refused).
- **All-Brands device scope**: a platform-scoped device matches SMS globally across all brands with safe cross-brand re-attribution via `SmsParsedRepository::rebindToBrand()`.
- Real-time device online status (180s heartbeat threshold) driven by companion `POST /api/mobile/v1/devices/heartbeat`.
- SMS template management — platform-owned global templates created in All-Brands view; device sender whitelist includes platform templates so All-Brands templates apply to every paired device.

#### Security Hardening

- **Argon2id** password hashing for all admin and staff accounts.
- **TOTP two-factor authentication** (`two_factor_enabled`, `totp_secret_enc`) with replay protection.
- **Self-service password reset** — 256-bit random tokens; only SHA-256 hash stored in `op_password_resets`; single-use, 1-hour TTL, DB-clock freshness; no account enumeration on the forgot-password surface.
- **Rate limiting** (`RateLimiterMiddleware`) on authentication, password reset, OTP, and sensitive API endpoints.
- **`SecurityHeadersMiddleware`** — injects HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, and dynamic CSP on every response.
- **Parameterized PDO queries** enforced throughout; SQL string concatenation is strictly prohibited.
- Route parameter regex constraints prevent route-based injection; `{identifier}` is the sole exception allowing `@`, `+`, `%` for customer email/phone lookup.
- All secrets loaded from environment variables; `.env` excluded from version control.
- `window.opCopyText()` global clipboard helper in the admin panel — HTTP/HTTPS compatible clipboard fallback to prevent JavaScript clipboard API failures on non-secure local contexts.

#### API Layers

- **Merchant REST API** — authenticated via API key (`op_api_keys`); payment initiation, transaction status, refund, and webhook management endpoints.
- **Mobile API** (`/api/mobile/v1/`) — JWT-authenticated companion device endpoints: pairing, heartbeat, SMS submission, notification acknowledgment with device-UUID–scoped IDOR prevention.
- **Admin API** — internal admin-facing endpoints for live dashboard data and device status polling.
- **OpenAPI 3.1.1 specification** at `docs/v2/api/openapi.yaml`; interactive public API tester bundled in `docs/v2/api/`.
- **Webhook retry system** — failed webhook deliveries are queued and retried.

#### Notification & Email System

- Event-driven email notifications (`EmailNotificationService`) triggered on `payment.transaction.completed` and `refund.created`.
- Per-brand sender identity (`mail_from_email`, `mail_from_name`) resolved via the brand → global settings cascade.
- Email failure is fully isolated inside try/catch and never disrupts payment completion.
- Transactional email templates: `payment_completed.twig`, `refund_created.twig`, `password_reset.twig`.

#### Fee Rules Engine

- `op_fee_rules` — brand-scoped commission configuration with four-tier specificity resolution: Brand+Gateway → Brand+Any Gateway → Global+Gateway → Global+Any Gateway.
- Currency is an exact `CHAR(3)` match; no currency-agnostic fallback.
- `FeeRuleRepository::resolveActiveRule()` resolves the most specific active rule at transaction time; ties broken by newest rule ID.

#### Brand Theme Engine

- `BrandThemeService` — resolves per-brand visual identity with field-level priority: brand-scoped `op_system_settings` → `op_merchants.settings` JSON → global settings.
- Fields: `name`, `logo`, `favicon`, `color`, `accent_color`, `support_email`, `custom_css`, `custom_js`, `footer_text`, `show_powered_by`.
- Per-brand logo and favicon uploaded to `public/assets/uploads/brands/`.
- Custom CSS/JS injected raw into checkout templates; theme hook triggers fire via `checkout.head` and `checkout.footer` filters.
- **`own-pay` default theme plugin** bundled under `modules/themes/own-pay`.

#### Addon Plugins

- **`mail-gateway` addon** — pluggable transactional mail transport.
- **`sms-gateway` addon** — pluggable outbound SMS transport for OTP and notifications.
- **`telegram-bot` addon** — Telegram bot integration for real-time payment notifications.
- **`example-kit` addon** — developer reference addon demonstrating the plugin API.

#### Developer Tools & Observability

- **Audit log** (`op_audit_log`) — tamper-evident event trail for all security-relevant operations with integrity hashing.
- **Cron runner** (`CronJobRunner`) — declarative cron scheduling via plugin manifests; `RefundReconciliationJob` reconciles gateway refund states on schedule.
- **CLI tools** (`cli/`) — developer command-line utilities.
- **Balance verification report** — cross-checks ledger balances against transaction totals.
- **Multi-language (i18n) system** — file-based translation loading with auto-recovery directory management.
- **Contributors dashboard** — live GitHub contributors data visualisation in the admin panel.
- **Landing page CMS** — full-featured public marketing page with admin-editable content blocks.
- **PHPStan Level 9** static analysis enforced across the entire codebase with zero allowed errors.
- **390+ PHPUnit test cases** covering business logic, ledger invariants, plugin lifecycle, security controls, and regression guards.
- **Twig CS Fixer**, **ESLint**, and **Stylelint** integrated for template, JS, and CSS quality gates.
- **WooCommerce gateway plugin** (`ownpay-wordpress.zip`) for WordPress/WooCommerce e-commerce integration.

#### Database Schema

- All tables prefixed with `op_`; strict naming conventions enforced (e.g. `two_factor_enabled`, `totp_secret_enc`, `decimal_places`, `base_currency`, `target_currency`, `match_status`, `device_id`).
- **Stored Generated Columns** on `op_transactions` — `invoice_id` and `payment_link_id` extracted from `metadata` JSON as indexed `BIGINT UNSIGNED STORED` columns for hot-path lookups without JSON extraction overhead.
- `op_system_settings` — unified key-value store replacing the decommissioned legacy SQLite `op_env` table; nullable `merchant_id` with `uk_group_key_merchant` unique constraint enables brand-scoped overrides alongside global defaults.
- `op_password_resets` — OWASP-aligned token table: `token_hash CHAR(64) UNIQUE`, `used_at` (NULL until consumed), `expires_at`, `user_id FK → op_merchant_users ON DELETE CASCADE`.
- `op_cache` — generic key/TTL cache store; used for JTI blacklisting and rate limiter state.
- 16 sequential migration files (`database/migrations/`) bootstrapping the complete schema and seeding default data.
- **Decommissioned and purged**: `op_settlements`, `op_settlement_items`, `SettlementService`, `SettlementRepository`.
