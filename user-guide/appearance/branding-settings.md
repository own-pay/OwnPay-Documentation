## Best Practices

- ✅ **Do:** Use transparent PNG or SVG vector files for the **Site Logo** to ensure it displays correctly in both light and dark display modes.
- ✅ **Do:** Keep the **Site Meta Description** between 150 and 160 characters to optimize search engine snippet previews.
- ❌ **Don't:** Upload large image files (e.g. over 1MB) for the logo or favicon, as they will slow down page load times.
