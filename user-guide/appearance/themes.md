## Overview

The Themes page manages the HTML/CSS template envelopes used to render customer-facing checkout interfaces (`/checkout/{token}`) and payment link sheets (`/pay/{slug}`). OwnPay supports modular theme plugins that change layouts, animations, and input patterns.

* **Version & Author:** Package version and developer credits (e.g. `v2.0.0 - Own Pay`).
* **Description:** Details outlining features of the theme (e.g. "Default Own Pay checkout theme - premium, responsive, multi-gateway").
* **Controls:** Click **Activate** to make this the active global checkout theme, or **Remove** to delete the files from the server.

### 2. Install Theme

## Step-by-Step: How to Use This Page

### Activating a Theme

## Configuration Guide

* **Theme Slug Mapping:**
  * System settings save the active theme identifier in database settings as `active_theme`.
  * The default theme has a manifest slug of `own-pay`.
  * Visual assets (logos, favicons, custom colors) configured under **Branding Settings** or brand contexts are injected into Twig templates dynamically.

## Best Practices

- ✅ **Do:** Test custom themes on desktop and mobile browsers to ensure input fields (like the card or phone number boxes) remain accessible.
- ✅ **Do:** Keep the default `own-pay` theme installed as a fallback.
- ❌ **Don't:** Delete an active theme. Always activate an alternative template first.
- ❌ **Don't:** Upload unverified zip archives as they could contain malicious code.
