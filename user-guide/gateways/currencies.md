## Page Sections

The payment settings panel provides the following configurations:

### 1. Currency & Exchange Rates
* **Default Currency:** The base currency used to invoice customers and credit your ledger. Supported default options include:
  * `BDT - Bangladeshi Taka`
  * `USD - US Dollar`
  * `EUR - Euro`
  * `GBP - British Pound`
  * `INR - Indian Rupee`
* **Exchange Rate Update:** Choose how multi-currency checkouts calculate rates:
  * **Automatic:** Periodically updates currency conversion factors using public rates APIs.
  * **Manual:** Let's you hardcode static rates for your conversions under the settings database.

### 2. Lifecycles & Verification
* **Payment Expiry (minutes):** Defines the active lifespan (between 5 and 1440 minutes, defaulting to 30) of an unpaid checkout page. Once reached, the transaction state transitions to `cancelled` or `expired`.
* **Invoice Due Days (default):** Automatically sets the payment deadline (between 1 and 365 days, defaulting to 7) for newly generated customer invoices.
* **Auto-approve verified payments:** Toggle to authorize checkout checkups. When enabled, transactions that match an incoming parsed SMS transaction ID are completed automatically without administrative review.

## Configuration Guide

* **Exchange Rates Calculations:**
  * When a customer pays in a currency different from your default store currency, the checkout calculations map the target currency amount using the rate configured here.
  * If using **Automatic** updates, make sure your cron tasks are running to fetch updated rates from the external API provider.

## Best Practices

- ✅ **Do:** Keep the **Payment Expiry** duration long enough for customers to navigate their banking apps (usually 15 to 30 minutes).
- ✅ **Do:** Enable **Auto-approve verified payments** if using a paired SMS parsing Android device to reduce manual auditing workloads.
- ❌ **Don't:** Change the default currency frequently, as it will affect historical reporting and ledger balances across different periods.
- ❌ **Don't:** Set invoice due days to more than 90 days unless offering custom commercial terms.

---

## Must Do

> ⚠️ Ensure the server cron job scheduler is running if you set **Exchange Rate Update** to **Automatic** to prevent stale conversion rate calculations.

---

## Optional / Can Skip

- Multi-currency configs and exchange rate update rules can be ignored if you only charge customers in your base currency.

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Checkout page times out too fast for customers | The payment expiry duration is set too low (e.g., 5 minutes). | Increase the expiry duration to at least 15 or 30 minutes and save settings. |
| Automatic rates are not updating | Stale cache or the external exchange rates service API is blocked by system firewalls. | Switch the setting to **Manual** to override values temporarily, or check developer error logs. |
