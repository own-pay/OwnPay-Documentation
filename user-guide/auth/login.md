> **Purpose:** Secure entrance gateway for super-administrators and authorized staff members to access the OwnPay admin panel.

## Overview

The Login page is the primary security gate of the OwnPay platform. To prevent unauthorized access to sensitive financial ledger data, only pre-registered staff members and the super-administrator can sign in. The page supports brute-force lockout protections and secure session management.

## Getting Here

To access the login page:

2. Navigate to your master OwnPay domain followed by the login slug: `https://your-domain.com/login` (Note: The default slug is `login`, but this can be customized in the Landing Page settings for additional security).

### Sign In Box

## Configuration Guide

The path and access rules of the login screen can be customized by the super-administrator:
* **Admin Login URL Slug:** You can change the route from `/login` to a customized slug (e.g. `/secure-gate-7x2`) under the Landing Page Settings. If changed, any attempt to access the old `/login` URL will return a **404 Not Found** page.
* **Brute-Force Lockout:** After five (5) failed login attempts within a 5-minute window, the account is temporarily locked. The lockout duration is 5 minutes before you can try again.

## Best Practices

- ✅ **Do:** Change the default `/login` slug to a random, hard-to-guess word to mask the admin panel from automated bot scanners.
- ✅ **Do:** Only check the **Remember me** option on personal, fully encrypted devices.
- ❌ **Don't:** Share login credentials among staff members. Always create dedicated staff accounts with role-based permissions.
- ❌ **Don't:** Attempt to log in over a public, unencrypted HTTP connection. Ensure the address begins with `https://`.

## Must Do

> ⚠️ Always ensure that the browser address bar displays the correct domain name and a secure lock icon (SSL/TLS active) before entering your credentials.

---

## Optional / Can Skip

- **Remember me** is entirely optional and can be left unchecked for normal security compliance.

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Invalid credentials` error message | Typo in email/username or password. | Re-verify your credentials and type them carefully. Note that passwords are case-sensitive. |
| `Account temporarily locked` error | Too many incorrect login attempts in a short timeframe. | Wait 5 minutes for the lockout window to expire, then try again. |
| `404 Not Found` when visiting `/login` | The admin login slug has been changed by the super-administrator. | Access the admin panel using the custom slug configured in your settings. |
